# DataLayer
Basic communication between Android wearable and handheld.

Using this app the wearable can send a string message to a handheld and the other way around using DataLayer, pressing the specific buttons on the wearable you can make tha handheld vibrate or play a random sound effect or turn the flashlight on/off.

There is a little to do list as well, shared between the handheld and wearable, the list is not yet persistent, but will try to do that as well.
