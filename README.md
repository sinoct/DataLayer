# DataLayer
Basic communication between Android wearable and handheld.

Using this app the wearable can send a string based message to a handheld and the other way around using DataLayer, pressing the specific buttons on the wearable you can make the handheld vibrate or play a random sound effect or turn the flashlight on/off.

There is a little to do list as well, shared between the handheld and wearable. It's nothing fancy, the list is stored locally on both devices in the memory so it's not persistent but if you tap on the items they will turn green.
